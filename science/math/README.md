### Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem

The **Collatz conjecture** is a [conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjecture) in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) that concerns a [sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence) defined as follows: **start with any** [**positive integer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_integer) **n**. Then each term is **obtained from the previous term as follows**: if the previous term is ****[**even**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_%28mathematics%29), the next term is **one half of the previous term**. If the previous term is **odd**, the next term is **3 times the previous term plus 1**. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach **1**.
