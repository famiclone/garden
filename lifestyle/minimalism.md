# Minimalism

## Notes

Our possessions possess us.

This is how we let go.If a thing stops adding value, sell it.

If it doesn't sell in a week, lower the price.

If it doesn't sell in 30 days, donate it.

If a donation place doesn't accept, recycle it.

If it can't be recycled, trash it \(as a last resort\).

Once we let go, we're able to move on.
